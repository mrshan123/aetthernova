<!-- Week 3: Operating Systems & File Management -->
<section id="lesson-3">
    <h2>Operating Systems & File Management</h2>

    <!-- Lesson 1: What is an Operating System (OS)? -->
    <div class="lesson">
        <img src="standard-quality-control-collage-concept.jpg" alt="Operating System Overview">
        <div class="lesson-content">
            <h1>What is an Operating System (OS)?</h1>
            <p>An <strong>Operating System (OS)</strong> is system software that manages hardware and software resources on a computer or other electronic device. It serves as an interface between the computer hardware and the end users, allowing users to interact with the computer in an efficient and organized way. The OS controls and coordinates the computer's operations, ensuring that the hardware components function together and that software applications run smoothly.</p>

            <h2>Key Functions of an Operating System:</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Process Management:</h3>
            <p>The OS is responsible for creating, scheduling, and terminating processes. It allocates CPU time to various tasks and ensures that multiple processes can run concurrently without interference. For example, if you are editing a document while running a music player, the OS ensures that both tasks are executed without one crashing the other.</p>

            <h3>2. Memory Management:</h3>
            <p>The OS manages the system's memory, both primary (RAM) and secondary (storage). It ensures that memory is allocated and deallocated efficiently, preventing conflicts and errors. For example, the OS will free up memory once an application is closed, ensuring there is enough space for other applications to run smoothly.</p>

            <h3>3. File System Management:</h3>
            <p>The OS organizes and controls how data is stored and retrieved on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and optical discs. It provides an interface for the user to create, delete, and manipulate files and directories. For example, when you save a file on your desktop, the OS decides where to store it on your hard drive and ensures that it can be easily found later.</p>

            <h3>4. Device Management:</h3>
            <p>The OS manages hardware devices such as printers, monitors, storage devices, and input/output devices. It ensures smooth communication between hardware components and software applications via device drivers. For instance, if you plug in a new printer, the OS will automatically install the necessary drivers to enable printing.</p>

            <h3>5. Security and Access Control:</h3>
            <p>The OS enforces security policies, ensuring that unauthorized users do not access the system or its data. It provides features like user authentication, access control lists, and encryption. For example, when you log into your computer with a password, the OS verifies your identity and prevents unauthorized access to your files.</p>

            <h3>6. User Interface:</h3>
            <p>The OS provides a user interface (UI) for interacting with the system. This could be a <strong>command-line interface (CLI)</strong> or <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong>, depending on the system. For example, Windows provides a GUI where users can click icons, while Linux can be used through both a CLI or a GUI depending on the setup.</p>

            <h2>Types of Operating Systems:</h2>
            <h3>1. Desktop Operating Systems:</h3>
            <p>Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. These OSs are designed for personal computers, providing a user-friendly interface and supporting a wide range of applications. Windows is commonly used in business and personal settings, while macOS is preferred by designers and media professionals.</p>

            <h3>2. Mobile Operating Systems:</h3>
            <p>Examples: Android, iOS. These are optimized for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, featuring touch-based interfaces and mobile-specific features. For example, Android offers extensive customization options, while iOS provides a streamlined, uniform experience.</p>

            <h3>3. Server Operating Systems:</h3>
            <p>Examples: Windows Server, Linux Server, macOS Server. These are designed to run on servers, offering features like high performance, scalability, and security for managing networked resources. Windows Server is often used in corporate environments, while Linux Server is widely used for web hosting and cloud services.</p>

            <h3>4. Embedded Operating Systems:</h3>
            <p>Examples: Embedded Linux, RTOS (Real-Time Operating System). These OSs are used in specialized devices such as printers, routers, medical equipment, and industrial machinery. RTOS is designed for applications that require real-time processing, such as controlling machinery in a factory.</p>

            <h2>Examples of Popular Operating Systems:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Windows</strong>: One of the most widely used operating systems for personal computers, developed by Microsoft.</li>
                <li><strong>macOS</strong>: The operating system developed by Apple for their computers, known for its sleek design and integration with other Apple devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Linux</strong>: A free, open-source operating system used on servers, desktops, and embedded systems, known for its stability and security.</li>
                <li><strong>Android</strong>: An operating system for mobile devices, developed by Google, widely used on smartphones and tablets.</li>
                <li><strong>iOS</strong>: The operating system used on Apple's mobile devices like iPhones and iPads, known for its security and seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem.</li>

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <h3>Lesson 1: What is the Internet & How Does it Work?</h3>
            <p>The internet is a global network of computers and servers that are interconnected and communicate through various protocols. It allows users to access information, communicate, and interact with others across the world.</p>
            <h4>How the Internet Works:</h4>
            <p>When you visit a website, your computer sends a request to the server that hosts the website, and the server responds by sending the data back to your computer. The data travels through several intermediate devices, such as routers, before reaching you.</p>
            
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>If you type <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">www.example.com</a> into your browser:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your browser sends a request to the ISP's DNS server to resolve the domain name.</li>
                <li>The DNS server translates <code>www.example.com</code> into an IP address (e.g., <code>93.184.216.34</code>).</li>
                <li>The request is routed through the internet, passing through various routers until it reaches the websiteâ€™s server.</li>
                <li>The websiteâ€™s server sends back the data to your computer, and your browser displays the page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lesson 2: Web Browsing & Search Engines</h3>
            <p>Web browsers allow users to access and interact with websites. A search engine helps you find websites by entering keywords or phrases.</p>

            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google:</strong> The worldâ€™s leading search engine. Simply type in a query, and Google will provide a list of websites that match.</li>

                <li><strong>DuckDuckGo:</strong> A privacy-focused search engine that doesnâ€™t track your searches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How to Use a Web Browser:</h4>
            <p>To visit a website, you type its address (URL) into the browserâ€™s address bar. To search for something, simply type a keyword into the search bar, and the browser will open a search engine.</p>
            
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Open Google Chrome.</li>
                <li>In the address bar, type <code>www.google.com</code> and press Enter to visit Google.</li>
                <li>In the search bar, type "best movies of 2025" to see a list of related results.</li>
